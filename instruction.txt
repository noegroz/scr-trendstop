### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Run setup.sh ("bash setup.sh")
    It should install the necessary Debian/Ubuntu packages and the additional Python modules.
    (Tested on Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit.)

2.  Run the script ("python3 script.py [opt]") 
    $ python script.py -h
    Usage:
       script.py -i sector_index_start[:sector_index_end] [-c concurrent_processes_num] [-p http_proxy:port]
    Note:
       The sector index ranges from 0 to 306.
    Example:
       Extracting company profiles from the sector with index 0:
          script.py -i 0
       Extracting company profiles from the sector with index 20 until 22:
          script.py -i 20:22
       Extracting company profiles from the sector with index 7 until 10 using 2 concurrent processes:
          script.py -i 7:10 -c 2

3.  The output should be generated in the folder 'out'.


### NOTE

For test run, please try this:
    python3 script.py -i 16
